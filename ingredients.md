INGREDIENTS AND SUBSTITUTES
Chicken - I always use thighs. Because I think it's more juicy and tender than breast meat. And yet, you can also use chicken breast of course. 
Tomato paste - I like using a little bit of tomato paste for the color and thickness it adds. But, you can also omit it.
Sour cream- I like sour cream in this, but if you prefer you can use yogurt instead.
Spice mix – Almost everyone has these common spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and paprika. They are found in most Indian or Middle Eastern dishes. And yet, if you don’t have these, you can substitute the powders in the recipe with 2 tbsp of curry powder.
Curry powder - Curry powder is readily available in most supermarkets these days. So, if you don't have the spices below don't worry too much, just add two heaping tablespoons of curry powder. Make sure you buy the curry powder that is right for you, not-spicy, medium or hot. I make my own so you can find my homemade curry powder as well as garam masala. So, if you like making your spice mixes, you will love to try these. 
you can add different things according to your wish.
