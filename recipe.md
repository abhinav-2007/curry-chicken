PREPARE.

Clean, wash and chop the chicken.
Season with salt pepper and lemon juice - and set aside.
Add all the paste ingredients to a food processor and blend until smooth.
COOK THE CURRY
Heat oil in a saute pan large enough for the whole recipe.
Add the ground paste and cook on medium heat for about 3 minutes.
If necessary, add a few tablespoons of water to prevent the spices from burning.
You will know the spices are cooked when you get a nice spice aroma in the house.
Next, add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir well.
Add the chicken pieces and coat well with the mixture.
Add one cup of water and stir.
Cook for about 8 to 10 minutes until the chicken is cooked.
Add sour cream and stir well.
Check and adjust seasoning.
Sprinkle with more chopped cilantro before you serve.
